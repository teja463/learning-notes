# Users And Permissions

## Users

* Organizations are an entity in Liferay that can group users in a distributed hierarchy. Practically, this means that large organizations can empower and delegate Users to administer their Organizations.
* User Groups are another way to group Users to simplify administration and assigning Roles. User Groups are simple lists of Users that can have Roles assigned to them.
